# 🚇 FACE_PAY – Face Recognition Based Ticketing System

**FacePay** is a smart facial recognition ticketing system for public transport. Built using Flutter and Python (Flask), this solution allows users to register their face and use it as a digital ticket — eliminating the need for physical cards or QR codes. Admins can monitor real-time station crowd flow via a web-based dashboard.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🎭 **Face as a Ticket** – No need for cards or tokens.
- 📲 **Flutter App** – User registration, login, wallet balance, face upload.
- 🧠 **Flask Server** – Handles face recognition, wallet deduction, and DB ops.
- 🧬 **InsightFace + Faiss** – High-accuracy face embedding and matching.
- 📊 **Admin Panel** – HTML/CSS/JS dashboard with live crowd data (via user logs).
- 🗃️ **MySQL DB** – Stores user info, wallet, and station logs.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User registers** via the Flutter app and uploads a face image.
2. Flask backend:
   - Extracts face embeddings using **InsightFace**
   - Stores user and embedding data in **MySQL**
3. At station entry/exit:
   - Face is scanned by a webcam-connected device running Flask
   - **Faiss** searches for the closest face match
   - If matched → fare is deducted and logged in the `user_log` table
4. The **Admin Panel** fetches real-time `user_log` data using JavaScript and displays live station-wise activity.
